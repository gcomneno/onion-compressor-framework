SEMANTIC NUMS – regression playground

# date-like ("-" should remain TEXT, not unary sign)
date=2024-01-01

# ranges ("-" should remain TEXT)
range=10-12

# minus after identifier ("-" should remain TEXT)
x-1

# unary sign in standard context (should be part of NUM)
(-0012)
+0012
-0012

# mixed punctuation contexts
total: -42, delta=+7; bracket[+9]; eq=-3; list: 1,2,3

# edge cases: sign not unary (should stay TEXT)
expr=1+-2   # here '+' is binary-ish; '-' should not be treated as unary sign
expr2=1--2  # two dashes, both should stay TEXT
